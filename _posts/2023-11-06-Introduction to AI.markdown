Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to algorithms and software in machines or computers that can perform complex or human-like tasks. A key feature of AI systems is that they are designed to adapt or learn from large amounts of data to optimise their performance. 

## Key Concepts
**Algorithms** are a series of instructions or procedures that solve a particular problem of task. They provide a systematic way to manipulate data or perform computations.

**Computations** refer to the operations performed on data values or symbols which can involve basic arithmetic or logical operations.

**Data** are facts, figures or information that can be collected and stored. It can take many forms such as text, numbers, images or sounds.

**Digital** representation of data stores information in discrete values (e.g., binary values are either 0 or 1) rather than analogue representations which are continuous.

**Models** are representations of a system, process or phenomenon, typically used to facilitate the analysis, prediction or understanding of a complex real-world system. 

**Optimisation** refers to the process of finding a best solution or ideal state by making something as effective and efficient as possible. This typically involves identifying constraints and objectives such as the maximisation or minimisation of a key variable.

**Variables** store or represent a value that can change or vary.
